Previously, I attended the University of North Texas through its Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science.

Currently, I am building a startup called [Coordinated Care Inc.](https://www.coordinatedcareinc.com)</a> with 
to build a web app based service to coordinate the transfer of

Often, these post-acute rehab patients transferred from large urban hospitals to smaller hospitals
find that they are in facilities better equiped for dealing with day-to-day recovery problems and are closer to their families. 
Also, medicare pays more to these smaller hospitals for rehab care. We envision that our app will help save small rural hospitals from 
having to shut down in today's
