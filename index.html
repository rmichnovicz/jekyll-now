<p>Hello! I'm Randy, and I am in my fourth year studying Computer Science at Georgia Tech with Intelligence and Devices threads. 
Previously, I attended the University of North Texas through its Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science.</p>

<p>Currently, I am building a startup called <a href="https://www.coordinatedcareinc.com">Coordinated Care Inc.</a> with 
<!--
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tee-faircloth-31b60653/>Tee Faircloth</a> and Nathan Scott -->
to build a web app based service to coordinate the transfer of 
<a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/SNFPPS/SwingBed.html">swing bed patients</a>. 
Often, these post-acute rehab patients from urban hospitals find that they are in facilities better equiped for dealing with 
day-to-day recovery problems and closer to their families in smaller hospitals. 
Also, medicare pays more to these smaller hospitals for rehab care. We hope that our app will help save small rural hospitals from 
having to shut down in todays <a href="https://www.realclearhealth.com/articles/2018/03/15/rural_americas_health_care_crisis.html">
